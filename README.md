# Introduction to Deep Learning

## Season of Code 2025

 - In the first week, I learned what neural networks actually are and what logistic regression means
 - In the second week, I learned about the process of how logistic regression works, forward and backward prop, gradient descent etc.
 - In the third week, I learnt how to build a neural network and how to implement it in code, using vectorisation to optimise the process
 - In the fourth week, I built an entire softmax regression neural network on the MNIST dataset from scratch to classify handwritten images.
